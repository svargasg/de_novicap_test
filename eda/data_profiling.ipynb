    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- aws credentials file correctly configured on your local machine with enough permissions to read the csv file from s3\n",
    "- python 3.8-3.9 virtual environment installed and activated (will be used for this notebook)\n",
    "- python requirements installed (run step below only once)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSV sample file was uploaded to AWS S3 as it is (data & structure, filename was renamed), maintaining data privacy in a secure cloud environment.\n",
    "- The following script could be simpler if profiling is done on a local file instead of the aws cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced feature\n",
    "\n",
    "If new files are received for profiling and automated work is required, a dag can be created in Airflow that reuses the script below to complete the following flow:\n",
    " \n",
    "* read file from s3 -> generate profiling report -> upload report to the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the previous, an analyst could simply execute a dag to receive a data profiling report."
